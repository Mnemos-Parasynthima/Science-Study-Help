			<div id="intro">
				<p>Many organisms, such as humans, contain a crucial system to their body, the skeletal system. The skeletal
					system is made up of many bones,
					ligaments, tendons, and cartilages that work and stay together to perform various tasks. The structure
					and arrangement depend on the
					male and female skeletons differ in mass and shape. Despite the differences, there are some common
					grounds, such as the divisions into the axial and
					appendicular skeleton. These differences will be further explained in a later section.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="function" class="info">
				<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

				<p>The main responsibility for the skeletal system is to provide a structure to the human body. However, it is
					not the only function of the skeletal system.
					Other functions include protection of vital organs, such as the skull protects the brain, and the ribs
					protect the heart and lungs, allowing movement,
					producing blood cells, and storing nutrients and other minerals. Without the skeletal system, everyone would
					be a non-motile mass of organs.
					Each organ in the skeletal system provides a specific function that contributes to the overall function of
					the skeletal system.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="organs" class="info">
				<h2>Organs</h2>

				<h3>Bones</h3>
				<p>Bones are the primary organs that comprise the skeletal system. Bone tissue, also called <b>osseous
					tissue</b>, is a dense,
					hard connective tissue that forms the skeletal structure. Bone tissue come in two categories: compact bone
					tissue and spongy bone tissue.
				</p>
				<p>Compact bones-also called <b>cortical bones</b>-are the dense tissues found on the exterior of the bone.
					Despite being found in the exterior, compact bone is surrounded by a thick fibrous membrane called the
					periosteum.
					However, not all compact bones are covered by periosteum; in some places, such as joints, cartilage covers
					the area.
					Furthermore, blood vessels perforate the periosteum and the cortical bone tissue via pores. The blood
					vessels not only run through the compact bone,
					but as well as the spongy bone,
				</p>
				<p>Spongy bone-also called <b>cancellous bone</b>- is the bone tissue found within the bone itself and it is
					composed of blood vessels,
					frail fibers, lamallae, and mostly empty cavity. In long bones, such as the femur or the tibia, bone marrow
					is found within certain areas of the spongy bone.
					Yellow bone marrow is used for storing energy such as triglycerides, while red bone marrow is where
					production of blood cells is found.
					Blood vessels run through the spongy bone to supply it with nutrients and it is distributed throughout the
					bone marrow.
				</p>

						target="_blank" class="styleExceptions">Visible Body</a>. </caption>
				</div>

				<h3>Ligaments</h3>
				<p>Ligaments are the dense, connective, and flexible tissue that connect bones to each other for proper bone
					articulation.
					Ligaments are made up of dense, collagenous fiber bundles. Even though ligaments have the same composition,
					variety occurs.
					Ligaments can be categorized as white ligaments and yellow ligaments. White ligamnets are made up mostly of
					collagenous fibers, and are sturdy and elastic,
					while yellow ligaments are rich in elastic fibers- tough, yet, allowing movement.
				</p>
				<p>In joints, ligaments form a sac around the ends of acticulating bones and a membrane that lubricates the bone
					for movement.
					In other places, ligaments form bands across bone ends to permit a certain range of rotation, or tie bones
					together to restrict movement that might not appropiate.
				</p>

				</div>

				<h3>Tendons</h3>
				<p>Tendons are connective tissues that usually connect muscles to bones. Tendons transmit the force created by
					connecting muscles to the bones in its other connecting end. Their strength is necessary to maintain under
					stress levels generetaed my muscles,
					and it is due to the orientation, structure, and tissue composition that makes its strength.

				</div>

				<h3>Cartilage</h3>
				<p>Cartilage is a connective tissue that binds and articulates bones. It is composed of a network of collagen
					fibers
					embedded in a gelatinous substance. Cartilage can be found in joints, in between the vertebrae, and at
					ligaments and tendons. There are three types of cartilage:
					hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and elastic catilage. Hyaline cartilage is the typical cartilage, found
					as articular carilage, ends of bones, and in the face.
					Fibrocartilage is a strong tissue that it is found as intervertebral disks and at the insertions of tendons
					and ligaments. Elastic cartilage, on the other hand,
					is yellow in appearance, and contains elasti fibers in conjungtion to collagen. It makes up the external
					ear, auditory tube, and the epiglottis.

			<div id="divisions">
				<h2>Axial and Appendicular skeletons</h2>

				<h3>Axial Skeleton</h3>
				<p>The axial skeleton is composed of the bones that make up the axis of the body, such as the head, spine,
					chest, and the neck.
					In total, there are about an average of 80 bones in the adult skeleton. The axial bones are: skull bones,
					auditory ossicles, hyoid, vertebral column,
					and the thoracic cage.
				</p>
				<p>The skull is the structure that protects the brain and forms the face. It is composed of 22 bones that are
					further divided:
					cranial bones and facial bones. The cranial bones include the parietal bone, temporal bone, and the
					occipital bone.
					These bones form the majority of the skull and help protect the brain. The facial bones, such as the nasal
					bone, maxilla, mandible, and the zygomatic bone,
					are found at the front of the skull, and also make up the face's structure.
				</p>
				<p>The auditory ossicles are the six bones, three on each side, that work to gather and transmit vibrations in
					the air to the brain,
					in other words, to hear. These bones, the hammer (<i>malleus</i>), anvil (<i>incus</i>), and stirrup
					(<i>stapes</i>),
					are the only bones that can fit within the ear canal, therefore, small. The hammer is connected to the ear
					drum, which transmits the vibrations to the anvil,
					then to the stirrup, in which sends the amplified vibration to the fluid-filled cochlea for translation into
					nerve signals.
				</p>
				<p>The hyoid bone rests below the jaw bone and above the larynx, also called the voice box.
					Its only function is to anchor the muscles of the tongue and throat. Furthermore, it does not connect to
					other bones, only to tendons and muscles.
					Not only it anchors muscles, but it plays a role in swallowing and sound production. The hyoid is the only
					bone that it is isolated from other bones via
					joints or cartilage.
				</p>
				<p>The vertebral column is the axis of the body. It serves to protect the spinal cord, support the back, and
					distribute the weight
					and pressure during walking, running, or any physical activities. The vertebral column is made up of 26
					bones: 24 vertebrae and two are the sacrum and coccyx.
					The vertebrae can be further divided into three groups: cervical vertebrae-seven bones found at the neck-,
					thoraic vertebrae-12 bones found in upper back-,
					and lumbar vertebrae-five bones found in lower back. The vertebral column comes in a s-shape, and this helps
					it absorb and distribute the shocks and weight.
					Without the curvature, the shocks would be conducted straight to the head, which may lead to damage to the
					brain.
				</p>
				<p>The thoraic cage is another important structure, as it protects the heart, lungs, and other organs.
					This structure is composed of the sternum, 12 pairs of ribs (24 in total), and 12 thoraic vertebrae. The
					ribs are curved,
					flattened bones that are connected to their corresponding vertebrae and to the sternum. The top seven ribs
					are connected to the sternum via the coastal cartilage,
					these are called "true ribs". Out of the remaining five ribs, also called "false ribs", three are connected
					to the cartilage above them.
					The remaining two are called floating ribs, as they are not connected to the sternum. The floating ribs have
					their coastal cartilage connected to the abdominal muscle.
					Even though the rib cage is semirigid, it has the ability to expand and collapse during breathing to make
					space for the dilating lungs.

						target="_blank" class="styleExceptions">lumen</a>.</caption>
				</div>

				<h3>Appendicular Skeleton</h3>

				<p>Attached to the axial skeleton is the appendicular skeleton. 126 bones consist the appendicular skeleton,
					in which they make up the arms and legs, and connectors to the axial skeleton. The appendicular skeleton can
					be seen in four parts:
					the pectoral girdle, the upper limbs, the pelvic girdle, and the lower limbs.
				</p>
				<p>The pectoral girdle is the structure of bones that connect the arms to the axial skeleton.
					The pectoral girdle is composed of the clavicle and the scapula. There are one of each per side, and they
					are joined by ligaments and joints.
					The clavicle is attached to the sternum while the scapula is attached to the ribs.
				</p>
				<p>The upper limbs are also called the arms. Each arm is consisted of 30 bones, which are: the humerus, radius,
					ulna, carpals, metacarpals,
					and phalanges. The largest bone in the upper limbs is the humerus. The humerus is connected to the pectoral
					girdle via the head and to the ulna and radius via
					the radial and coronoid fossa. The ulna and radius make up the forearm, and are attached to each other by
					the interosseous membrane.
					Connected to the raduis and ulna are the carpals by the radiocarpal joint. The wrist and the base of the
					hand are formed by the carpal bones,
					eight small bones connected to each other to form the midcarpal joint. The radicarpal and midcarpal joints,
					in conjunction,
					are responsible for the articulation of the hand. The palm is consisted of five elongated metacarpal bones.
					These bones articulate with the carpals at the carpometacarpal joints. The metacarpal of the thumb is
					seperated from the rest of the metacarpal bones.
					This seperation allows it to move independently from the other bones, a crucial structure for the mobility
					of the thumb.
					The other ends of the metacarpals articulate at the metacarpophalangeal joints with the phalanges. These
					joints are what form the knuckles of the hands.
					At the other end of the joints are the phalanx bones (phalanges in plural). These bones are what form the
					fingers. There are a total of 14 phalanges in the hand;
					two form the thumb (proximal and distal phalanges) and three form each finger (proximal, middle, and distal
					phalanges).
					Each phalanx bone is connected to the adjacent one by interphalangeal joints. Overall, each joint and bone
					is held together
					by ligaments spanning across the articulation points. If any ligament is severed, it might affect the
					movement of the hand depending on its location.
				</p>
				<p>The pelvic gridle, also commonly know as the hips, is the area where the axial skeleton connects to the
					appendicular skeleton,
					specifically to the lower limbs. The pelvic gridle is made up of two hipbones, one per each leg. Each
					hipbone has three different parts:
					the illium, the ischium, and the pubis. The illium is the fan-like top region of a hip bone. Below the
					illium, the ischium is firmly connected to it.
					This structure serves as a place for attachment of the thigh muscles. Completing the pelvic girdle, the
					pubis is the anterior region of the hipbones.
					The pubis and the ischium are connected by the ischiopubic ramus. Together, the pubis and ischium create a
					region for the lower limbs to connect.
				</p>
				<p>Like the upper limbs, the lower limbs, also called the legs, are consisted of 30 bones per leg.
					They are the femur, tibia, fibulla, patella, tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges. Similar to the humerus,
					the femur is the largest (and strongest)
					bone of the appendicular skeleton and the entire skeletal system. The head of the femur is attached to the
					hipbone to form the hip joint.
					The lower region of the femur joins with the fibula and tibia. In addition, the patella, a semasoid bone,
					can be found in this joint.
					The patella's main purpose is to protect the tendon found in the region from any wearing by the femur.
					However, the patella does not articulate with the tibia and the fibula. The tibia and fibula function like
					the radius and ulna from the upper limbs.
					They are attached to each other by the interosseous membrane. At the root of the tibula-fibula complex, the
					tarsals can be found.
					They are the seven bones that make up the ankle and the base of the base of the foot. Each bone, the talus,
					calcaneus, cuboid, navicular, medial cuneiform,
					intermediate cuneiform, and lateral cuneiform, articulates with each other allowing movement. The center of
					the foot is composed of the metatarsals,
					which are found between the tarsals and the phalanges. Like the metacarpals, the metatarsals are five
					elongated bones that articulate with the phalanges
					to form metatarsophalangeal joints. At the end of the foot, the toes are composed of 14 total phalanx bones,
					similar to those in the hands.
					The toe has two phalanx bones, the proximal and distal phalanges, while the rest have three, the proximal,
					middle, and distal phalanges.
					Between adjacent phalanx bones, joints can be located. Alike to the hands, these joints are called the
					interphalangeal joints.
					These bones are also connected by ligaments and tendons, which also serve the purpose of moving our feet.
					Without them, we would be non motile.

			<div id="cooperation" class="info">

				<h2>Cooperation with other systems</h2>
				<p>No system works independently. Each system cooperates with another to fully perform its necessary functions.
					The skeletal system works mainly with the muscular system, along with the circulatory and nervous. Since the
					skeletal and muscular system work together frequently,
					it can sometimes be called as the musculoskeletal system. In order for bones to articulate, it needs the
					assistance of tendons to connect to the muscles.
					When a muscle contracts, its corresponding bones are moved closer. If any tendon or muscle is severed, the
					bone can no longer move.
					Another example of coherence is with the circulatory system. Because the bone marrow produces blood cells,
					the skeletal system is an important factor
					to the circulatory system. Without the bone marrow, the circulatory system would not function.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="diseases" class="info">
				<h2 id="illnesses">Illnesses</h2>

				<p>Illnesses can affect from a single organ to an entire structure. Leukemia, kyphosis, and osteoporosis are
					some conditions
					that can affect the skeletal system, either in a bone or an entire structure. Leukemia is a type of cancer
					that affects the blood and the bone marrow.
					It begins in a cell in the bone marrow. As any type of cancer, it duplicates itself until the cancerous
					cells dominate the bone marrow.
					The cells may live longer and find its way to other regions of the skeletal system into the circulatory
					system. There are differen types of leukemia,
					each having a different rate of cell duplication and survival. Some include acute lymphoblastic, acute
					myeloid, chronic lymphocytic, and chronic myeloid leukemia.
					For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.lls.org/leukemia" target="_blank"
					class="styleExceptions">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>.
				</p>
				<p>Another type of disease that can affect the skeletal system is osteoporosis. According to the <a
					href="https://www.nof.org/patients/what-is-osteoporosis/" class="styleExceptions"
					target="_blank">National Osteoporosis Foundation</a>, osteoporosis is a bone disease that occurs when
					the body loses too much bone,
					makes too little bone, or both; as a bones become weak and may break from a fall or, in serious cases, from
					sneezing or minor bumps.
					Since bones have the porous spongy bone, the cavity between the tissue is larger than normal. This causes
					fragility in the bone tissue,
					making it vulnerable to any small damage to the bone. Furthermore, other diseases are likely to increase the
					chances of osteoporosis occuring, such as:
					thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, leukemia, Parkinsos's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.
