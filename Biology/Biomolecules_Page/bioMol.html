      <p>All life is made up of building blocks. Those building blocks are elements. Elements may combine to form large
        molecules called macromolecules.
        Depending on which elements are used, biomolecules can be formed. The four elements used to form biomolecules
        are: Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen,
        and Phosphorous. With these 5 elements, 4 biomolecules can be created: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Protein, and
        Nucleic Acids. Each type of molecule has
        different structure, characteristics, and functions. All organic compounds have to contain Carbon (next to
        Oxygen) in order to be classified as biological.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, there are building blocks within these biomolecules. These are called the monomers; polymers are
        the biomolecules that monomers form when
        they are stringed together. The polymers can get in shapes and forms to create complex 3D structures.</p>

      <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
      <img src="img/carbs2.gif" id="carbs2">
      <img src="img/carbs1.jpg" id="carbs1">
      <p>Carbohydrates are part of our daily life. Some foods that include carbohydrates are breads, pasta, rice,
        potatoes, and other foods that can contain wheat
        and corn. This foods give us quick and easily usable energy; therefore, the function of carbohydrates is to
        supply give quick and usable energy.
        Carbohydrates are also called sugars as some examples of carbohydrates are glucose, fructose, deoxyribose, and
        galactose. The monomer for carbohydrates
        is a monosaccharide. Two saccharides form a disaccharide for the prefix di- means two. Some examples are sucrose
        (also known as table sugar), lactose, and maltose.
        Three or more saccharides in a chain are called polysaccharides, prefix poly- meaning many. Some examples are
        glycogen, cellulose, and starch.
        The elements that make up carbohydrates are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>

      <p>Mostly all carbohydrates are in a ring structure, making it more sturdious.
        In order to make it easier to use, carbohydrates break done through the process of hydrolysis. This occurs when
        a water molecules joins the disaccharides
        or polysaccharides and breaks them apart, returning them to their original monosaccharides. When polysaccharides
        need to be formed, dehydration takes place.
        This occurs when monosaccharides lose a water molecule to join together. The process repeats for each two
        saccharides until it forms a polysaccharide
        such as cellulose. These reactions occur at enzymes. More information about enzymes are covered in the protein
        section. The general nomenclature ending of
        saccharides is -ose. A prefix sometimes can indicate how many carbons are included in the sugar; such as pentose
        (5 carbon sugar), and hexose (6 carbon sugar).

    <div id="lipids" class="info">
      <h2>Lipids</h2>

      <img src="img/lipids.jpg" id="lipid1" alt="Lipids">

      <div id="lipid1Modal" class="modal">

      </div>
      <p>Lipids are also called fats, but people consider them as bad. Lipids are beneficial in specific amounts.
        Objects that have lipids are oils, waxes, chocolate,
        and many more. Lipids supply a long-term energy that can be used for activities that need energy for a long
        period of time, such as swimming
        a great distance. When compared to carbohydrates, lipids will last time while carbohydrates will be hydrolyzed
        quickly. The monomers for lipids are glycerols
        and fatty acids. Fatty acids are hydrocarbons that can extend depending on the type of lipid with a carboxyl
        group at its end. Fatty acids can be either
        saturated or unsaturated. Saturated lipids have a straight backbone while unsaturated lipids have a carbon
        double bond at the middle, making a bend.
        Glycerol is a compound made up by carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. It's a propane with 3 hydroxyl groups at three
        of its side hydrogens.</p>
      <img src="img/lipids1.png" id="lipid2">
      <img src="img/lipids2.png" id="lipid3">
      <p>Most lipids are hydrophobic, meaning that they fear water. However, when combined to other structures, one side
        (the fatty acids) is hydrophobic
        while the other side (depends on the structure) is hydrophilic, water-loving. Some lipids are possible with only
        the fatty acids, while
        others have a grycerol. Some lipids can use all three of the hydroxyl groups while some only use one. In
        addition, groups such as phosphates or other
        organic molecules can join to the grycerol to form longer and complex structures. Such examples include
        phospholipids
        (have the traditional lipids with two tails and a phosphate group along with choline at the and, making it
        polar) or triglycerides
        (using all three hydroxyl groups at the glycerol). With these different types of lipids, each have a different
        function depending on where they do it.
        Phospholipids make up membranes, triglycerides make up animal fat, cholesterol also sometimes make up
        memebranes, and many other functions.</p>

      <h2>Proteins</h2>
      <img src="img/aminoAcids.jpg" id="aminoAcid">
      <p>Proteins are considered one of the most important macromolecules. These molecules give us the enzymes and other
        structures that are needed for
        many things in our body systems. Foods high in protein are meat, nuts, fish, chicken, beans, and many more. We
        need a continous intake of protein
        as our body uses them everyday to make many molecules. Some functions of proteins are to carry oxygen, attack
        germs and viruses, transport molecules
        through membranes that are imbedded in the phospholipid bi-layer, and many more. In shorter words, they are for
        growth and repair. Some examples
        of protein are: hemoglobin, lactase, and actin. The monomer of a protein is called an amino acid. Amino acids
        are composed of an amine group (NH2) and
        a carboxyl group (COOH) with an alpha carbon (along with a hydrogen) connecting them. At the alpha carbon,
        another side chain can be added.
        This side chains are the ones that give the properties of each amino acids. Some side chains are proline,
        tryptophan, tyrosine, and methionine, including more.
        Each side chain can be either polar, nonpolar, or electrically charged (can also be either acidic or basic). The
        order of amino acis and the side chains
        indicate the function of the protein. The amino acids each have an end. The side where the amine group is found
        is called the N-terminus, while the other
        side is called the C-terminus. In each side, other amino acids join by a peptide bond. </p>
      <img src="img/aminoAcids1.png" id="aminoAcid1">
      <img src="img/aminoAcids2.jpeg" id="aminoAcid2">
      <p>Sometimes, proteins form enzymes. Enzymes speed up the reactions of various activities. They break down complex
        molecules into simpler ones. Such examples are with carbohydrates. When sucrose is taken in, its specific
        enzyme, sucrase, locks into the shape of sucrose and
        hydrolysis occurs, breaking down the disacharide into its two monosaccharides. The intake of the enzyme is
        called the substrate while the end
        result is called the product. It is said that enzymes are catalysts and they catalyze reactions. Some people can
        lack some enzymes. In result, those
        people cannot intake the substrate of the missing enzymes in large quantities. One such example is with lactose.
        Some people are lactose intorelant.
        This means that they lack the enzyme lactase, in which means that they cannot digest quickly lactose. There are
        other enzymes that people also lack,
        but lactase in the most common one. As seen before, the nomenclature ending of enzymes is -ase. This means that
        they can catalyze sugars or other structures.</p>

      <h2>Nucleic Acids</h2>
      <img src="img/nucleicAcid.jpg" id="nucleicAcid">
      <p>Nucleic acids are all around us, we have nucleic acids. Without them, we couldn't exist. With this, all living
        things have nucleic acids, such as flowers,
        strawberries, apples, apes, and more. The purpose of nucleic acids is to code for the proteins and other things
        necessary for the sustaining of life. Each
        thing nucleic acids code are needed to make what we are. DNA and RNA are the nucleic acids that are universal.
        Other sub-types of nucleic acids include
        mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA. Each type of nucleic acid has a specific function under the normal function. DNA holds the
        code necessary in the nucleus. mRNA
        transcribes the code into a usable strand. tRNA holds amino acids and joins other amino acids based on the
        codons (three bases at a time) of the mRNA.
        rRNA makes up ribosomes that holds the place for the translation of mRNA. The monomer of nucleic acids is a
        nucleotide. It contains a phosphate group (PO3),
        a deoxyribose sugar (or ribose sugar for RNA), and one of four nitrogenous bases-or heterocyclic amines-(Uracil
        for RNA, Thymine for DNA). The elements
        that make up nucleic acids are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus.</p>

      <p>DNA has a double helix backbone that curves all the way. The rungs inside it are the nitrogenous bases. DNA is
        compacted into chromosomes by protein histones.
        RNA is just a singe strand with nitrogenous bases poking out. The interaction between DNA and RNA is explained
        in the DNA Processes section.
        Each strand is held by hydrogen bonds between oppposing bases. Adenine between thymine (or uracil) and cytosine
        between guanine. Each base is categorized
        into two groups: pyrimidines and purines. Each base in each group have a common structure. Pyrimidines are
        hexagons while purines have a hexagon shape
        combined with a pentagon shape. The hydrogen bonds can be two or three depending on the bases. Regarding to the
        backbone, one strand points toward one
        direction, while the other strnad into the opposing one. This all depends on the direction of the sugars. Each
        carbon is counted clockwise from the oxygen.
        This results in one carbon being 5' (prime) and 3'. This directs the direction of the strand. One strand runs
        from 3' to 5' while its counterpart
        runs 5' to 3'. This is necessary for the replication of DNA and the transcription of DNA into RNA. DNA is the
        most important molecules necessary for life and
        the coming generations.</p>
