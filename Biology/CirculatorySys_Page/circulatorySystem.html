        <h2>Function</h2>

        <p>The responsibility of the circulatory system is to keep flow of blood, nutrients, hormones, oxygen, and other gases to and from the cells. 
          With out it, the body would be defendless, lacking homeostasis, and not having oxygen.
          It is very pivotal to all of us. The functions divide furthermore by organs explained by the next chapter.

      <div id="organs" class="info">
        <h2>Organs</h2>
        
        <h3>Heart</h3>
        <p>The circulatory has one large organ and other small ones. The large one is the pumper, the heart.
          The heart's function is to pump blood from the lungs to the rest of your body. It is made of an involuntary muscle called the cardiac muscle.
          It is the only muscle that you cannot control it, hence the name in voluntary. 
          It has four chambers: left ventricle, right ventricle, left atrium, and the right atrium. 
          A ventricle is on the same side as the atrium.
          <sup>1*</sup>Oxygen-rich blood comes from the lungs via the <em>pulmonary veins</em> to the <em>left atrium</em>. 
          Passes the <em>bicuspid/mitral </em> valve to the <em>left ventricle</em>.<sup>*1</sup> <sup>2*</sup> 
          It then goes through the <em>Aortic valve</em> through the <em>Aorta</em><sup>*2</sup> and finally to the rest of the body.
          <sup>1*</sup>Then, the <em>oxygen-poor blood</em> comes from the <em>inferior</em> and <em>superior vena cava</em> to the <em>right atrium</em>.
          It gets pushed through the <em>tricuspid</em> valve into the <em>right ventricle</em><sup>*1</sup>. 
          <sup>2*</sup>After, the blood goes through the <em>pulmonary</em> valve<sup>*2</sup>. And finally to the lungs to get re-oxygenated. 
          That is how much happens in such a 1-second breath. The hearth functions in a LUB/DUB sound. The LUB goes through <sup>1*1</sup> and the DUB through <sup>2*2</sup>. 
          The beating is controlled by nerves and 'nerve stations' in differents parts of the heart.
          One called the <i>SA</i> or <i><u>s</u>ino<u>a</u>trial node</i> and the other one called the <i>AV</i> or <i><u>a</u>trio<u>v</u>entricular node</i>. 
          They are located in the right atrium, sending messages through the septum to the apex and to the ventricles via the nerves.

        <h3>Blood vessels</h3>

        <p>There are three <i>major</i> types of blood tubes or vessels. The first one is an <i>artery</i>. 
          It contains <i>oxygenated blood</i> going to the body. The next type is the <i>vein</i>. 
          It holds <i>de-oxygenated blood</i> going back to the heart.
          There are two minor types. One sprouting from a vein and the other one from an artery. They are the <i>venule</i> and the <i>arteriole</i>. The final one are the <i>capillaries</i> with a very complex network.
          It's the transfering of arteries (oxygenated blood) to veins (de-oxygenated blood). They are really thin that mere one [red] blood cell can pass through.
          <i>Venules</i> and <i>arterioles</i> both connect via the capillaries. Each vessel has different 'walls'; having same number of walls, yet one is thicker than the other.
          Going from external to internal, the walls of a vein are: <i>fibrous connective tissue (Tunica adventitia),
          external elastic tissue, smooth muscle (Tunica media),</i> and <i>endothelium (Tunica intima)</i>. It also contain
          a valve so blood doesn't runs backwards, since it travels anti-gravity motion. 
          The walls for the artery are the same names but the difference is the <i>Tunica media</i> in the artery.
          It's thicker than the vein, therefore, the <i>internal elastic tissue</i> and the <i>Tunica intima</i> are narrower than the vein. 
          **Note**   The vessels closer to the heart are way thicker than the normal vessels.  
          The capillaries only contain one layer; the endothelial cells or also called <i>Tunica Intima</i>.
        </p>

        <h3>Components of blood</h3>

        <p>The blood is not only made up of red blood cells but it also contains other various types of components. 
          They are: red blood cells (also called <i>Erythrocytes</i>), white blood cells ( <i>Leukocytes</i>), <i>platelets, plasma, 
          fibrinogen</i>, and other more tiny components. There are different types of <i>leukocytes</i> including <i>monophils, t-cells, 
          basophils, neutrophils, monocytes, phagocytes</i>, and many more. They are included in the immune system or lymphatic system. 
          Most of the components are made in the bone marrow inside the bones. The erythrocytes are for carrying O<sub>2</sub> using <i>hemoglobin</i>. 
          Hemoglobin consists of 4 parts. 2 &alpha; globin and 2 &beta; globin. Each globin contains a heme group which carries an <i>Fe</i> atom. 
          There are thousands of hemoglobin in a single erythrocyte. Leukocytes defend the body, plasma is just liquid with solutes and proteins,
          platelets are for clogging any trespass or hole in the vessels along with fibrinogen which form a net so the platelets can stick to it.

      <div id="cooperation" class="info">

        <h2>Cooperation of other systems</h2>
        <p>The circulatory doesn't works alone, it has a bond between other systems. 
          Such as the respiratory, lymphatic, digestive, excretory, nervous, skeletal; basically all of the systems. 
          It primarily works with the repiratory and the lymphatic systems. The circulatory conects to the lungs by the alveoli inside the lungs. 
          There, the de-oxygenated bood in the capillaries drops off CO<sub>2</sub> and collects O<sub>2</sub> by the protein, hemoglobin. 
          It can be described more in the respiratory system page <a href="respiratorySystem.html" target="_blank" >here</a>. It also works with the lymphatic system. 
          The lymphatic is the defending system. It contains leukocytes and lymph (a liquid). 
          The leukocytes from the circulatory, when in emergency, go toward the "damaged area" via the lymph vessels. 
          So it is another important system to the circulatory. It doesn't have major impact of other body systems but they are nessesary.

        <h2>Diseases</h2>

        <p> According to the <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/" target="_blank">American Heart Association</a>, 
          cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US. One of the most common diseases is arterioclerosis, 
          in which the lipid deposits in the arteries causes the walls to stiffen and thicken the walls. 
          This can restrict blood flow or in severe cases stop it all together, resulting in a heart attack, or stroke. <br>
          <br>
          Another disease, hypertension -commonly called high blood pressure- causes the heart to work harder and can lead to such complications as a heart attack,
          a stroke, or a kidney failure. <br>
          <br>
          An aortic aneurysm occurs when the aorta is damaged and starts to bulge or eventually tear, which can cause severe internal bleeding. 
          This weakeness can be present at birth or the result of atherosclerosis, obesity, high blood pressure or as well as a combination of all these conditions.<br>
          <br>
          Peripheral arterial disease (a.k.a PAD) usually involves areas of narrowing or blockage within an artery. 
          In addition, chronic venous insufficiency (a.k.a CVI) involves areas reflux (or backward flow) within the superficial veins of the lower extremities.

        <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The circulatory system streches out for about 60,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) long. It can go around the Earth approximately 2.5 times.</li>

          <li>Erutrocytes are special, because they have no nuclei. Lacking this large intenal structure, it has more room to carry oxygen. 
          But without the nucleus, the erythrocyte cannot divide or synthesize new cellular components.</li>

          <li>Human blood doesn't comes in blue. The reason being is of the wavelengths of light that penatrates the skin. 
          They are absorbed and reflect back to the eyes. But other animals' blood can come in different colors llike blue.</li>

          <li>Due to the heart having its own electrical impulse,
          it will continue to beat even after being removed from the body as long it has a supply of oxygen.</li>

          <li>The power output of the heart ranges from 1-5 watts per minute. Which is the equivalent to the usage of a 60 watt bulb. 
          It is said that enough energy is produced a day to drive a truck 20 miles.
